# Overview

DaisyFileInput is a button-styled file selector that displays a “Choose File” affordance with the current file name beside it. It supports DaisyButton variants, size presets, and a customizable `FileName` placeholder. Use it when you need a themed file picker entry point; wire it up to your file dialog logic in code-behind.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `FileName` | Text shown on the right side; default “No file chosen”. Update this after a file dialog completes. |
| `Variant` | DaisyButton variant for the choose-file segment (Default, Primary, Secondary, Accent). |
| `Size` | Height/font scaling (ExtraSmall, Small, Medium, Large, ExtraLarge - theme styles defined for XS/Small/Medium/Large). |

## Quick Examples

```xml
<!-- Basic -->
<controls:DaisyFileInput />

<!-- With variant and preset filename -->
<controls:DaisyFileInput Variant="Primary" FileName="photo.jpg" />

<!-- Compact -->
<controls:DaisyFileInput Variant="Accent" Size="Small" />
```

## Wiring a file dialog (code-behind)

```csharp
private async void OnPickFile(object? sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var picker = new OpenFileDialog { AllowMultiple = false };
    var result = await picker.ShowAsync(this);
    if (result != null && result.Length > 0)
    {
        FileInput.FileName = Path.GetFileName(result[0]);
    }
}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- Keep `FileName` short; long paths should be truncated or replaced with the file's leaf name.
- Pair with validation text or `DaisyAlert` for upload constraints (size/type).
- Use `Variant="Primary"` for key upload actions; use Default/Accent for secondary forms.
- Remember to set focus/keyboard handling as you would with a standard button; this control is still a `Button`.
