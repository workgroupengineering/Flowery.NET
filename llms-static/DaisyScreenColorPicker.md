# Overview

DaisyScreenColorPicker is an eyedropper tool that allows picking colors from anywhere on the screen using a **click-and-drag** interaction. Unlike traditional color pickers that require clicking to start and clicking again to select, this control uses a more intuitive drag gesture: click and hold to start, drag anywhere on screen while watching the live color preview, then release to capture the color.

## Interaction Model

**Click-and-Drag to Pick:**

1. **Click and hold** the left mouse button on the control
2. **Drag** the cursor anywhere on screen (even outside the application window)
3. Watch the **live color preview** update as you move
4. **Release** the mouse button to capture the color at the cursor position

This interaction model is similar to how eyedropper tools work in professional design software like Photoshop or Figma.

**Cancellation:**

- Release the mouse button outside the control while not over a desired color
- Press **Escape** while dragging
- If pointer capture is lost (e.g., window loses focus), picking is automatically cancelled

## Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `Color` | `Color` | `Black` | The selected/captured color |
| `IsCapturing` | `bool` | `false` | Whether the picker is currently in drag-capture mode (read-only) |
| `OnColorChanged` | `Action<Color>?` | `null` | Optional callback when a color is captured |

## Events

| Event | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `ColorChanged` | Fired when a color is successfully captured (on mouse release) |
| `PickingCompleted` | Fired when picking is completed successfully |
| `PickingCancelled` | Fired when picking is cancelled (Escape or capture lost) |

## Visual Display

The control displays a compact panel (140×80 pixels) showing:

- **Color swatch** - Large preview of the current/preview color with checkerboard for transparency
- **Hex value** - Color in #RRGGBB format
- **RGB values** - Individual R, G, B component values
- **Status text** - "Click & drag to pick" or "Release to pick" during capture
- **Eyedropper icon** - Visual indicator when not capturing
- **Green border** - Indicates active capture mode

## Platform Support

| Platform | Support |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Windows** | ✅ Full support using GDI32 `GetPixel` API |
| **macOS** | ⚠️ Limited - drag works but color capture may not function |
| **Linux** | ⚠️ Limited - drag works but color capture may not function |

The control uses Windows-specific P/Invoke calls (`GetCursorPos`, `GetDC`, `GetPixel`) for screen color capture. On non-Windows platforms, the drag interaction works but the color value won't update.

## Quick Examples

```xml
<!-- Basic eyedropper -->
<colorpicker:DaisyScreenColorPicker 
    Color="{Binding SelectedColor, Mode=TwoWay}" />

<!-- With callback -->
<colorpicker:DaisyScreenColorPicker 
    OnColorChanged="{Binding OnScreenColorPicked}" />

<!-- In a color picker toolbar -->
<StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Spacing="8">
    <colorpicker:DaisyScreenColorPicker x:Name="Eyedropper" />
    <TextBlock Text="Drag to pick a color from screen" 
               VerticalAlignment="Center" 
               Opacity="0.7" />
</StackPanel>
```

## Events and Callbacks

### Event-Based

```csharp
picker.ColorChanged += (sender, e) => 
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Captured: {e.Color}");
    // e.Color contains the picked color
};

picker.PickingCompleted += (sender, e) => 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Color picking finished");
    // Good place to close dialogs or apply the color
};

picker.PickingCancelled += (sender, e) => 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Color picking cancelled");
    // User cancelled - restore previous state if needed
};
```

### Callback-Based

```csharp
var picker = new DaisyScreenColorPicker
{
    OnColorChanged = color => 
    {
        Debug.WriteLine($"Picked: #{color.R:X2}{color.G:X2}{color.B:X2}");
        SelectedColor = color;
    }
};
```

## Code-Behind Usage

```csharp
// Create picker
var picker = new DaisyScreenColorPicker();

// Handle successful pick
picker.ColorChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    var capturedColor = e.Color;
    ApplyColor(capturedColor);
};

// Handle cancellation
picker.PickingCancelled += (s, e) =>
{
    // User cancelled - no action needed
};

// Read the current color
Color currentColor = picker.Color;
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Explain the interaction** to users - the click-and-drag model may be unfamiliar
- The control shows a **live preview** of the color under the cursor while dragging
- **Hex and RGB values** update in real-time during drag
- Works best on **Windows** - other platforms have limited color capture support
- Combine with `DaisyColorEditor` or `DaisyColorGrid` for a complete color picker interface
- The `IsCapturing` property can be used to conditionally show/hide UI elements
- Use `PickingCompleted` event to trigger actions after successful color selection

## Comparison with Traditional Eyedroppers

| Traditional | DaisyScreenColorPicker |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Click to start, click to select | Click-hold-drag-release |
| Two separate click actions | Single continuous gesture |
| May show floating preview window | Inline preview in control |
| Can accidentally click wrong spot | Release when you see the right color |
