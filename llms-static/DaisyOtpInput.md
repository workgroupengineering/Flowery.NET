# Overview

DaisyOtpInput is an OTP / verification code input composed of multiple single-character slots. It features **animated focus states**, auto-advance, backspace support, and digit-only filtering. It is designed for high-fidelity "Verify Code" screens with support for grouping (separators) and varying sizes.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Length` (int) | Number of OTP slots (default 6). |
| `Value` (string?) | Current OTP value (concatenated from the filled slots). |
| `AcceptsOnlyDigits` (bool) | When true, non-digit characters are filtered out (default true). |
| `AutoAdvance` (bool) | Automatically moves focus to the next slot after entering a character (default true). |
| `AutoSelectOnFocus` (bool) | Selects slot content when focused (default true). |
| `SeparatorInterval` (int) | Inserts a separator every N slots (0 disables separators). |
| `SeparatorText` (string) | Separator text (default `–`). |
| `Size` (`DaisySize`) | Size preset for the slots. |

## Events

| Event | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `Completed` | Raised when `Value.Length == Length`. |

## Quick Examples

```xml
<!-- Standard 6-digit OTP with separator -->
<controls:DaisyOtpInput Length="6"
                      SeparatorInterval="3"
                      Value="{Binding Code, Mode=TwoWay}" />

<!-- Alphanumeric code -->
<controls:DaisyOtpInput Length="8"
                      AcceptsOnlyDigits="False"
                      Value="{Binding Code, Mode=TwoWay}" />

<!-- Compact -->
<controls:DaisyOtpInput Length="4" Size="Small" />
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- Users can paste the full code into the first slot; the control distributes characters across slots.
- `Completed` can fire more than once if the value is re-set while still complete; treat it as “input is complete now” rather than a one-shot.
- You can restyle the slot/separator visuals via the `otp-slot` and `otp-separator` classes in your app styles.
