and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-11

### Added

- **DaisyDateTimeline**: New horizontal scrollable date picker inspired by Flutter's easy_date_timeline
  - 5 size variants, 3 header types (None, MonthYear, Switcher), 6 disable strategies
  - Marked dates with secondary color highlighting and tooltips
  - Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Home/End, Page Up/Down, Enter to confirm)
  - Mouse wheel scrolling and click-drag panning
  - AutoWidth mode to fit exact number of visible days
  - Vertical and Horizontal layout modes
- **DaisyDateTimelineItem**: Individual date cell control with selection, today highlight, and marker states
- Gallery: New "Date Display" section with DateTimeline and Timeline examples
- DaisyIcons: Added DaisyIconDateDisplay (calendar icon)

### Changed

- Gallery: Moved Timeline examples from "Data Display" to new "Date Display" section
- Docs: External links now open in new browser tab (target="_blank")
- Docs: DaisyDateTimeline* controls marked as custom (✦ badge in sidebar)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- DaisyTokens.axaml: Centralized design tokens for consistent sizing across controls (heights, fonts, padding, corner radii)
- DesignTokens.md: Documentation for design token system in llms-static/
- DaisyTabs: TabWidthMode property with Auto/Equal/Fixed modes to prevent layout shift
- DecimalExtensions: Static conversion methods for Hex/Binary/Octal/ColorHex/IP (for ViewModel use without control instance)
- Semantic content color resources (DaisyPrimaryContentBrush, DaisySecondaryContentBrush, etc.)

### Changed

- DaisyButton, DaisyInput, DaisySelect, DaisyNumericUpDown, DaisyTabs, DaisyBadge, DaisyFileInput: Refactored to use DynamicResource tokens
- Single-line controls now use fixed Height instead of MinHeight for accurate Size variant rendering

### Fixed

- DaisyButton/DaisyInput/DaisySelect/DaisyNumericUpDown/DaisyKbd/DaisyPagination: Size variants now display correct heights (MinHeight in nested Avalonia style selectors wasn't overriding base values)
- DaisyTabs: Fixed layout shift in Boxed and Lifted variants caused by FontWeight changes on selection
- DaisyInput: Watermark now respects VerticalContentAlignment property
- DaisyToolTip: Use semantic content brushes for variant foreground colors
- DaisyBadge/DaisyButton: Fixed foreground color handling with semantic content resources

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- DaisyThemeManager: `SuppressThemeApplication` property to prevent theme controls from overriding persisted themes during app initialization

### Fixed

- DaisyThemeDropdown: Constructor no longer overrides app's persisted theme preference. Dropdowns now sync to `CurrentThemeName` instead of applying "Dark" during construction.

## [1.0.9] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- DaisyThemeManager: `CustomThemeApplicator` hook allows apps to override default theme application behavior (e.g., in-place ThemeDictionary updates, persistence)
- DaisyThemeManager: `SetCurrentTheme()` helper method for custom applicators to update internal state
- Flowery.Capture.NET: New screen capture library for automated documentation screenshots (no NuGet yet)

### Changed

- Gallery: Auto-screen-grabbing of sections for docs

### Fixed

- ColorPickerDialog image display

### Added

- DaisyNumericUpDown: Full-featured numeric input control with:
  - Multiple number bases: Decimal, Hexadecimal (0xFF), Binary (0b1010), Octal (0o755), ColorHex (#FF5733), IPAddress (192.168.1.1)
  - Prefix/Suffix support for currency and units
  - Thousand separators with locale-aware formatting
  - Optional clear button (appears on focus, resets to 0)
  - Per-octet increment/decrement for IP addresses with wrapping behavior
  - Real-time input filtering and paste validation
  - Helper methods: ToHexString(), ToBinaryString(), ToOctalString(), ToColorHexString(), ToIPAddressString()

## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-07

### Changed

- DaisyInput: Refactored template to separate background Border from content (matching DaisyButton pattern). This prevents opacity issues where styling the border would unintentionally affect text visibility (dimmed text in unfocused state).
